# Restaurant Reviews Web-App
---

## Project Overview: Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for users.

### How do I start the project?

In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

### Why this project?

With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like. Explore the provided code, and keep an eye on the features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
The major purpose of this project was to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.
On a world where mobile devices are always with us, helping us with any daily task, it is essential for web applications to provide content as quickly as possible, and possibly without breaking the user's navigation because an internet disconnection.

### Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
